<body><![CDATA[It's the end of the road for John Henderson in Jacksonville. According to a report, the Jaguars will release the defensive tackle on Monday.

His agent would love to see him land back on his feet in his hometown of Nashville, with the Titans. Henderson played at Pearl-Cohn High and the University of Tennessee.

"One of his top priorities would be to come back home, that would always be a perfect fit,'' agent Tim McGee said. "Put it this way: Either way we'll talk, there's no question about that. We'll see what kind of interest the Titans have and I am pretty sure they'll feel us out to and we'll go from there.'']]></body>
